# Exercises for Robust Control of Mechatronic Systems
The exercises for my Robust Control of Mechatronic Systems course were given in two group projects (three students per group).

The first one is "Embedded control of an electric steering wheel" which was finished. The questions are in French, but the report is in English.

The second one is "Robust lateral control of autonomous vehicles" which is still ongoing. The questions are in English. The codes and report will come soon.
